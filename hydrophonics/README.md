# Hydroponic Irrigation System

This project is an irrigation controller tailored for hydroponic setups using a moisture sensor and relay-controlled water source.

## Features

- Monitors water/nutrient level
- Activates/deactivates pump based on sensor input

## Components Used

- Moisture Sensor
- Relay Module
- Water Pump
- Arduino Uno

## How it Works

- The system reads moisture or nutrient level.
- Turns on pump if water/nutrient is low.
- Turns off when the required level is reached.
