# Automatic Irrigation System

This Arduino-based project uses a soil moisture sensor to automatically control a water pump via a relay.

## Features

- Monitors soil moisture
- Turns on pump when soil is dry
- Turns off pump when soil is moist

## Components Used

- Soil Moisture Sensor
- Relay Module
- Water Pump
- Arduino Uno
- Jumper Wires
- Power Supply

## How it Works

1. The moisture sensor reads the soil moisture.
2. If moisture is below a certain threshold, the pump is turned ON.
3. Once the moisture level is adequate, the pump is turned OFF.
